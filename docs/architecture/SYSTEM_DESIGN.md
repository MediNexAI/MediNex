This document outlines the overall architecture of the MediNex AI system, including component interactions, data flow, and design decisions.

## System Overview

MediNex AI is built as a modular system with several key components that work together to provide medical AI capabilities:

          | Connector |   |          |
          +-----------+   +----------+
```

## Core Components

### 1. LLM Connector (`ai/llm/model_connector.py`)

The LLM Connector provides a unified interface to various LLM providers:

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Abstracting different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, etc.)
  - Handling authentication and API key management
  - Providing standardized prompting mechanisms
  - Managing context windows and token limitations
  - Error handling and retry logic

- **Design Decisions**:
  - Provider-agnostic interface allows for easy switching between LLM providers
  - Streaming support for real-time responses
  - Consistent error handling across providers

### 2. Medical Knowledge Base (`ai/knowledge/medical_knowledge_base.py`)

The Knowledge Base manages medical information and provides retrieval capabilities:

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Storing and indexing medical documents
  - Creating and managing vector embeddings
  - Providing semantic search functionality
  - Managing document metadata
  - Supporting CRUD operations on documents

- **Design Decisions**:
  - Vector-based storage for semantic similarity search
  - Chunking strategy for handling large documents
  - Metadata structure optimized for medical documents

### 3. Medical RAG System (`ai/knowledge/medical_rag.py`)

The RAG System combines the Knowledge Base and LLM for enhanced responses:

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Retrieving relevant knowledge for queries
  - Constructing context for LLM prompts
  - Generating responses with citations
  - Evaluating response accuracy

- **Design Decisions**:
  - Two-stage process: retrieve then generate
  - Configurable retrieval parameters
  - Source tracking for citation generation

### 4. Medical Imaging Pipeline (`ai/integrations/imaging_llm_pipeline.py`)

The Imaging Pipeline combines computer vision and LLMs for medical image analysis:

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Processing and analyzing medical images
  - Extracting visual features
  - Generating textual descriptions of findings
  - Integrating visual and textual information

- **Design Decisions**:
  - Modular design with separate image processing and LLM components
  - Support for various medical imaging types
  - Transfer learning approach for specialized models

### 5. API Layer (`ai/api/core.py`)

The API Layer exposes system functionality through REST endpoints:

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Providing HTTP endpoints for system functionality
  - Handling authentication and authorization
  - Request validation and error handling
  - Rate limiting and usage tracking

- **Design Decisions**:
  - FastAPI for high performance and automatic documentation
  - Pydantic models for request/response validation
  - JWT-based authentication

### 6. Distribution System (`ai/distribution/model_distribution.py`)

The Distribution System manages model versioning, packaging, and deployment:

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Model version control
  - Model packaging for distribution
  - Deployment management
  - License and access control

- **Design Decisions**:
  - Semantic versioning for models
  - Manifest-based packaging
  - Multiple deployment targets support

### 7. Contributor Management (`ai/contributors/contributor_manager.py`, `ai/contributors/revenue_sharing.py`)

The Contributor Management system tracks contributions and manages revenue sharing:

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Recording contributor information
  - Tracking contributions to models and data
  - Calculating revenue shares
  - Managing payment records

- **Design Decisions**:
  - Contribution tracking at multiple levels
  - Weighted contribution calculations
  - Automated revenue distribution

## Data Flow

1. **Query Processing**:
   - User submits a query via API
   - RAG system retrieves relevant knowledge
   - LLM generates response with context
   - Response with sources returned to user

2. **Image Analysis**:
   - User uploads medical image
   - Image processor extracts features and initial analysis
   - Analysis combined with medical knowledge via LLM
   - Detailed interpretation returned to user

3. **Knowledge Base Updates**:
   - New medical documents imported
   - Documents processed, chunked, and embedded
   - Vector index updated
   - Metadata stored

4. **Model Distribution**:
   - New model version registered
   - Model packaged with metadata and dependencies
   - Package deployed to target environments
   - Usage tracked for revenue sharing

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Security

- API key management
- JWT-based authentication
- HTTPS for all communications
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Access control based on user roles

### Performance

- Vector database optimization for fast retrieval
- Caching of common queries
- Efficient chunking strategies
- Batch processing for large operations

### Scalability

- Stateless API design
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Database sharding considerations
- Asynchronous processing for long-running tasks

## Future Directions

1. **Federated Learning**: Enable distributed model training across institutions
2. **Multi-modal Understanding**: Enhance integration of text, imaging, and structured data
3. **Real-time Collaboration**: Facilitate collaborative diagnosis and second opinions
4. **Expanded Medical Domains**: Add support for additional medical specialties
5. **Mobile-optimized Inference**: Optimize models for deployment on edge devices

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
- **Database**: Vector database (FAISS/Chroma), SQLite/PostgreSQL
- **AI/ML**: PyTorch, Transformers, OpenAI/Anthropic/HuggingFace APIs
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, optional Kubernetes
- **Frontend**: (Optional) React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
